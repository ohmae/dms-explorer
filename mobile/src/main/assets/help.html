<h1>What is this app?</h1>
<p>This app is a DLNA player.</p>
<p>You can view the contents of DLNA servers on the same network.</p>
<p>You will need to prepare a DLNA server in your own environment.</p>
<p>For more information on what DLNA is, please refer to the following website.</p>

<h1>What if I can't find the DLNA server?</h1>
<p>Please check the following</p>
<ul>
    <li>WiFi or wired LAN connection is required. It will not work over a cellular line.</li>
    <li>Make sure that a DLNA server is connected to the connected network.<br/>
        Also, make sure that the DLNA server is enabled in the settings of your server, etc.<br/>
        For information on how to set this up, contact the server manufacturer.
